For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

For the MoleculeRender part, I got core, completion and challenge.
For the ArrayQueue part, I got core and completion and challenge

I got a bit stuck on the ArrayQueue’s test class. Initially, I just totally have no idea how to write a test class. then I check the assignment3 ArraySet test class again and got some ideas how to write one.Honestly, I am still not sure if my test class is good enough.
 
For the ArrayQueue challenge part, it is not too hard for me and I think ArrayQueueCh is apart of ArrayQueue. basically, I just doing researches about “synchronized java block” and the ArrayQueueCh is similar to ArrayQueue beside using synchornized .The docs pretty much show me how every method should be set up.
  https://docs.oracle.com/.../concurrent/BlockingQueue.html...  
So I hope that I will get the point and some marks for the challenge.
For the Moleculerender challenge, well, the rotating x axis…my method looks like work fine. But the demo is too hard for me to check if my result is completely right.. But zoom in and zoom out works well.  

* What is the point of comparators?  Why are they necessary in general?
  Could you suggest an alternative way of solving the same problems that didn't
  involve having to make these additional classes?

The point of comparators obviously is to compare objects and order them in some kind of ways we want them to be. It's important because sometimes we need to deal with data and want them to be in a certain order and by comparing them using comparators it helps rearrange data. Honestly can't think of any other ways rather than making comparator classes as comparators are so good really enjoy using them.	


* Coming up with good test methods can be as hard as writing the code that it is
  testing.  Suggest some guidelines or principles for writing good test methods.

To be fair, I do not think that I am good at writing a test method.However so far as I 
understand, we probably allow the test class to test every single method as much as possible. And we might need to come up some different situations especially some typical situations (I may find what kind situations are typical from experience later). Anyway, this assignment and assignment3 gave me a good experience to practice and learn how to write a test class. I may need more practice which is another good to debug I think.
