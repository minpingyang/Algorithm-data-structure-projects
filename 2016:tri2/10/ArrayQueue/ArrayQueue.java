/**
 * ArrayQueue - a Queue collection;
 * 
 *   THIS VERSION IS BROKEN - IT HAS SEVERAL ERRORS.
 *   YOU NEED TO WRITE A TEST CLASS TO IDENTIFY THE ERRORS
 *   
 * The implementation uses an array to store the items.
 * It adds items at the back of the queue and removes them from the front
 * Removing items will leave space at the front of the array.
 *
 * It has two fields to record the front and the back of the queue:
 *  front is the index of the item at the front of the queue
 *  back is the index of the place where the NEXT item will be added
 *    (ie, one beyond the last item in the queue)
 * When front == back, then the queue is empty.
 * For example, if the queue currently has 3 items, A, B, and C,
 *  The fields might be:
 *   data:  | - | - | A | B | C | - | - | - |
 *            0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *   front: 2
 *   back:  5
 * If we then called offer("D"), it should be:
 *   data:  | - | - | A | B | C | D | - | - |
 *            0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *   front: 2
 *   back:  6
 * If we then called poll(), it should return A and be:
 *   data:  | - | - | - | B | C | D | - | - |
 *            0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *   front: 3
 *   back:  6
 * With three more calls to poll(), it should be empty:
 *   data: | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
 *            0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *   front: 6
 *   back:  6
 *
 * When back gets to the end of the array, it will make room for more items.
 * If there is enough room at the beginning of the array (head > 1/2 array length)
 * it will just shift all the items back to the beginning of the array.
 * For example, if we called offer("F") in the following state: 
 *   data:  | - | - | - | - | - | D | E | F |
 *            0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *   front: 5
 *   back:  8
 * It should move all the items down within the array, and then add "G":
 *   data:  | D | E | F | G | - | - | - | - |
 *            0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
 *   front: 0
 *   back:  
 * Otherwise, it will create a new array of double the 
 * current size, and copy all the items over to the new array,
 *
 * ArrayQueue extends AbstractQueue, so it only needs to implement
 *   size(),
 *   peek(),
 *   poll(),
 *   offer(), and 
 *   iterator().
