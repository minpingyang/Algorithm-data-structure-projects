 * Class Images implements a list of images.

 * Each image is represented with an ImageNode object.
 * The ImageNode objects form a linked list. 
 * 
 * An object of this class maintains the reference to the first image node and
 * delegates operations to image nodes as necessary. 
 * 
 * An object of this class furthermore maintains a "cursor", i.e., a reference to a location in the list.
 * 
 * The references to both first node and cursor may be null, representing an empty collection.
