Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. Did you do any online practice questions this week? If yes, which topics did
you look at and why?
no
Because I had done online questions one month ago.

2. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?

error: this.parameter should put first position in a method.
how I fixed it: I put the code which contains this.parameter in the first line under the method.
easier: remember to put this.parameter in the first line under the method.
  
3. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones? Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?

I think that the thing which is similar to previous  assignment is that use mouse action to draw some shapes. which is similar to the program minipaint. 
yes, I think this time is easier. Because I have ability to know how to use these point that mouse make to meet my program requirement.
I use public void doMouse(String mouseAction, double x, double y) method under the different mouse action to execute different tasks.

4. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.

I think that this assignment give me a chance to practise using interface to do the interesting assignment. In addition, the polygon part let me practise using array and arrayList again. Even if the polygon is a bit hard for me compare to previous challenge part.
