/** Exercise
 *    The program lets the user draw circles and move them around.
 *    The program has fields to store
 *     - an array of Circle objects
 *     - whether it is currently drawing new circles or moving them around
 *     - the index of the Circle the mouse was last pressed on.
 *    If the program is drawing new circles, then releasing the mouse
 *     on the graphics pane will create a new Circle at that point and add
 *     it to the collection.
 *    If the program is moving circles around, then if the mouse was pressed on
 *     top of a Circle, it will then be moved to the position the mouse is released.
