/** A Tightrope object represents an acrobat's tightrope strung between two poles.
 *   A Tightrope is drawn using two tall thin rectangles representing the two poles
 *   and a straight line between the poles.
 *   The poles go from the top of the pane (y = 0) to the ground (y=400).
 *     They should be 5 units wide.
 *     (Note, it is fine for this exercise to use the literal values (0, 5, 400)
 *      in your code, though good practice would define constants for them.)
 *   The tightrope can be raised, one end at a time.
 *   The Tightrope object needs to remember
 *     - the horizontal positions of the two poles (which don't change), and
 *     - the heights of each end of the "tightrope" line above the
 *       base (which do change)
 *   (Therefore, it needs at four fields, there are quite a lot of choices)
 *   The constructor requires two arguments:
 *      the horizontal position (mid point between the the two poles), and
 *      the width of the tightrope.
 *   Both ends of the tightrope are initially 20 units above the base
 *     of the poles.
 *   The constructor will draw the poles, and draw the tightrope in
 *     its initial position
 *   |           |
 *   |           |
 *   |-----------|
 *   |           |
 *   |    mid    |
 *
 *   The class has two methods:
 *     raiseLeft(double d),  which changes the height of the left end by the distance d
 *     raiseRight(double d), which changes the height of the right end by the distance d
 *   Both methods
 *     - erase the line from its current position, [UI.eraseLine(....)]
 *     - change the height of one end,
 *     - redraw the line   [UI.drawLine(....)]
 *     They don't need to redraw the poles.
 *     Note, for this exercise, it doesn't matter if the tightrope goes off
 *     the top of the poles!
