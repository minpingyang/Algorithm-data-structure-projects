/** A CameraAperture object represents the aperture of a camera, which can be opened or closed.
 *   It is drawn using a cicle outline of the camera lens, and a solid black circle
 *     representing the aperture. The aperture may be varied (in small steps) between wide open,
 *     (about 80% of the camera lens) and closed (about 20% of the camera lens)
 *   The CameraAperture object needs to remember
 *     - the position of the lens (which doesn't change), and
 *     the width of the aperture (which does change)
 *   The constructor requires two arguments:
 *      the x and y position of the lens
 *   The aperture is initially wide open
 *
 *   The class has two methods:
 *      open(),  which opens the aperture by a further 10% (unless it is fully open)
 *      close(), which closes the aperture by a further 10% (unless it is fully closed)
 *   They don't need to redraw the lens outline
